# Kafka-Spark Proof of Concept (POC) Data Pipeline

Here, I will be exploring the following streaming data technology use case: [Structured Spark Streaming + Kafka Integration](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-kafka-integration.html).

I will first test the code on my local machine and include a quickstart script for how to do this, but will also be launching the code in AWS. An architecture diagram will be added to this directory.

I will build on this by adding additional pipeline pieces such as replication to a database, batch data processing, simple visualizations and more.

I will include any lessons learned here as well.
