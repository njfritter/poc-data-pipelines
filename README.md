# Proof of Concept (POC) Data Pipelines

This repo is dedicated to testing out data technologies as well as highlighting my proficiency at building various types of data pipelines.

To start, I will be exploring simpler use cases with a combination of technologies that I have varying amounts of experience with. This will allow me to learn nuances and functionality of certain data technologies I have less experience with (i.e. streaming data use cases) while also learning how to piece them together with other technologies I have more experience with (i.e. batch data processing).

I will leverage the power of the cloud to simulate "production" conditions for these pipelines as much as possible.

I plan on using the information gained to tackle more complex use cases (including domains I am generally interested in), which will be placed in separate repos.

## The Pipelines

This section will be updated as I build out each of the pipelines:

1. Kafka Spark Streaming Pipeline
2. ?
